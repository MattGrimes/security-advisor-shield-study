#Security Advisor
Add-on prototype for warning users when their accounts may have been compromised. Provides
a warning whenever a user visits a site on the add-on's compromised site list.
Uses haveibeenpwned.com API to load in compromised site list. Can also use Normandy recipes
to add to list of compromised sites, as well as local data.

#To build
`$ npm install`
`$ npm run build`

This will create `@security-advisor-0.0.1.xpi`, which you can install in Firefox.

#To use
With the add-on installed, navigate to any of the sites victim to major hackings within
the past several years, such as Adobe. See full list at haveibeenpwned.com.
